Requirements to Build the Project
---------------------------------

I have built this project using CMake, GNU Make and GCC. If you have
these installed, then the project should work out of the box. If you
want to change to a different compiler or project file, it should be
trivial to configure CMake to accommodate the new setup. I have also
included a Visual Studio project file for convenience.

Check compile.sh, run.sh and test.sh for the steps to compile, run,
and run the unit tests.

Disclaimer
----------

This is my first C++ project since university. If I'm doing something
stupid, please let me know so that I can fix it.
